# Grid controller, peak events and the tariff

The third screen, the mechanism behind it, and the regulation that permits it.

Companion to `DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATION.md` (the resident's view) and
`HARDWARE_PROTOTYPE_SPEC.md` (the rig).

---

## 1. Why a second dashboard

A real peak is not a curve known in advance. It varies daily and the grid
operator is the one who knows. So SHARP has two authorities, and the idea book
already separates them:

> *Local power determines household stress, while historical grid curves or
> **authenticated events** determine grid stress.*

| Source | Used when | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| **Declared event** | the controller raises one | authoritative |
| Historical curve | no event is active | fallback |

The state feature is the same either way, so **no retraining is needed** to add
this. The model reads `obs_grid_peak_severity`; it does not care who set it.

### Three screens

| Screen | Audience | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| Resident | the citizen | appliances, protected vs shed, overrides |
| **Grid controller** | the DISCOM | declare event, severity, homes responding, MW relieved |
| Rig OLED | the room | what the hardware itself believes |

The OLED is not redundant. It reads local GPIO; the dashboard reads MQTT. If
they disagree you have found a real fault — a stuck relay, a dropped message, a
failed write — in front of the audience. Showing both is a confidence move.

## 2. The measured peak is midday, not evening

From the shipped context data, averaged over the validation period:

| Hour | Grid severity | Household kW |
|---|---|---|
| 03–07 | **0.000** | 0.16 |
| **08–13** | **0.42 – 0.67** | 0.17 |
| 14–17 | 0.47 – 0.59 | 0.15 |
| 18–23 | 0.000 | **0.24 at 19:00** |

**Grid peak 08:00–17:00. Household peak 19:00.** They are different events, which
is the classic Indian pattern: agricultural pumping and commercial cooling by
day, homes after work.

This is good news. The grid needs relief when houses are **empty**, so the
shedding costs residents least. Any demo script that says "evening, severity
crosses 0.5" is wrong against this data — severity is exactly zero in the
evening. **Run the demo peak at midday.**

## 3. The peak event

```
topic:  grid/<region>/peak_event      QoS 1, retained
```

```json
{
  "event_id": "apcpdcl-2026-09-15-001",
  "sequence": 47,
  "region": "guntur",
  "severity": 0.67,
  "declared_at": "2026-09-15T14:05:00+05:30",
  "expires_at":  "2026-09-15T16:00:00+05:30",
  "reason": "system_peak",
  "signature": "<base64 over every field above>"
}
```

### Five rules, and each exists because of a specific failure

**1. Signed, and verified on every Pi.** This broadcast sheds load in every home
that hears it. Broker ACLs are not enough — a leaked credential must not be
sufficient to switch off every television in Guntur, or to declare a false
all-clear during a real peak.

**2. `expires_at` is mandatory.** A stuck or replayed event must not hold luxury
off indefinitely. On expiry the Pi reverts to the historical curve by itself.

**3. Monotonic `sequence`.** Rejects replay of an old "peak on" after it ended.

**4. A local cap.** No event may keep luxury off for more than **8 consecutive
intervals** (two hours) without renewal. The Pi protects the resident even from a
malfunctioning control centre.

**5. A grid event can never touch a critical load.** `apply_shield` raises if a
peak lockout names a necessity appliance:

> *Critical loads cannot be locked out at peak. A peak restricts luxury; it never
> cuts essential service.*

Rule 5 is the one that makes this acceptable to a citizen. **Even the DISCOM
cannot take your fan.**

---

## 4. Two overrides, in series

There are two ways a resident acts, and they compose the way a real house does:

```
appliance runs  =  physical switch ON   AND   power available
                   ───────────────────         ────────────────
                   the resident's own          SHARP + shield +
                   wall switch                 peak lockout
```

This is not a convention. A wall switch and the DISCOM's supply are physically
in series, and every case falls out of it:

| Switch | SHARP allows | Result |
|---|---|---|
| ON | yes | runs |
| **OFF** | yes | **off** — the resident opened the circuit |
| ON | **no, peak** | **off** — no supply on that circuit |
| OFF | no | off |

**Neither path can force power on.** The dashboard sends a *request*; the switch
*permits*. That is why the peak lockout cannot be defeated from either side.

### Who is being constrained

| Actor | Action | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| **SHARP** | shed a critical load in use | **never** |
| **SHARP** | dim a critical load | **never, unconditionally** |
| **Resident** | switch off their own fan | **yes — it is their house** |
| **Resident** | switch on a locked-out luxury | **no — no power there** |

The shield protects essential service **from the controller**, not from the
person who lives there. It could not do the latter anyway: a fan has a physical
switch on the wall.

## 5. The tariff — what the law actually says

The **Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Amendment Rules, 2023**, notified
14 June 2023, mandate Time-of-Day tariffs:

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Peak-period tariff | **not less than 1.10 × normal** |
| Solar-hours tariff | **at least 20 % below normal** |
| Domestic consumers, effective | **1 April 2025** |

Two honest caveats, both of which must be stated:

1. A draft update pushes this to **April 2027** (C&I) and **April 2028** (others),
   tied to smart-meter rollout.
2. **APCPDCL's own FY2025-26 order still carries `time_of_day_rates: false`.**
   Mandated nationally; not yet implemented in this DISCOM.

So the correct framing is: *the Rules require ToD for domestic consumers,
APCPDCL has not implemented it yet, and SHARP is built for the tariff that is
coming.* Cite the 1.10× floor rather than inventing a number.

### The solar-hours conflict

The Rules make solar hours **cheaper**, but the measured grid peak here is
08:00–17:00, which *is* solar hours. These are different signals and must stay
separate:

| Signal | When | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| Grid stress | when the operator says | declared event |
| ToD price | fixed windows | the tariff order |

SHARP responds to the first. The bill reflects the second.

## 6. Paying to keep a luxury load during a peak

What this is, in the literature, is **Critical Peak Pricing** with opt-out.
Established practice, and three of its design rules matter here.

**Cap the events at 10–15 a year, published in advance.** Unlimited peak events
would let a DISCOM suppress luxury indefinitely, which breaks the promise that
supply is for everyone.

**Compensate off-peak.** CPP is not a pure surcharge: participants get cheaper
electricity the rest of the year. Without that it is a penalty, and a regulator
will reject it. A household that never opts out should end the year **paying
less**.

**Default to shed, allow opt-out.** Measured participation is **85 % for opt-out
against 28 % for opt-in**, so the default carries the programme.

### The flow

```
peak declared  ->  luxury sheds  ->  resident notified
                                        |
                    "Keep the AC on for this event?  about Rs 12"
                                        |
                       [ Keep it on ]        [ No thanks ]
                              |                     |
                    surcharge recorded      relief credited
```

### The statement

```
SHARP monthly statement — September 2026

  Energy, normal hours        118 kWh  x Rs 4.50      Rs 531.00
  Energy, peak hours            4 kWh  x Rs 4.95      Rs  19.80
    (1.10x normal, the floor set by the 2023 Rules)

  Peak events this month: 3
    14 Sep 14:05-16:00   opted out (air conditioner)  Rs 12.40
    22 Sep 11:00-13:00   participated                       -
    29 Sep 12:30-14:30   participated                       -

  Peak relief credit                                  -Rs 35.00
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                               Rs 515.80
```

The credit line is what makes it fair, and what a regulator would require. A
statement showing only the surcharge is not this mechanism.

---

## 7. The grid controller screen

| Panel | Shows |
|---|---|
| Declare | severity slider, duration, reason, **Declare** button |
| Active event | countdown to `expires_at`, renew, cancel |
| Response | homes reached / responding / opted out |
| Relief | kW avoided, and **"equivalent to N homes in 100 not blacked out"** |
| Audit | every event this month, who declared it, how long |

The relief line is the project's whole argument as a live number. On held-out
data SHARP cut household peak by **4.65 %** — the relief a rolling blackout would
get by cutting supply to **4.7 homes in 100**, delivered without cutting anyone.

The audit panel matters for the same reason the events are capped and signed:
a mechanism that can switch off appliances in many homes must be accountable to
somebody.

---

## 8. What must not be claimed

- Do not present the surcharge as operating under current APCPDCL tariffs. It is
  not in their order. It is what the 2023 Rules require and this DISCOM has yet
  to implement. Every amount the billing simulator shows under this mechanism is
  a **proposal**, and every figure it displays is **simulated** - labelled as
  such, with the tariff version and the assumptions beside it.
- Do not show a peak event as able to touch a fan, a light or a fridge. It
  cannot, and the shield raises rather than obeying.
- Do not imply the opt-out charge funds the project. It is a tariff mechanism,
  set by a regulator, not a fee.
- Do not run the demo peak in the evening. The data says the grid peak is
  08:00–17:00 and severity is zero after 18:00.
