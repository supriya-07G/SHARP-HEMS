# SHARP dashboard specification

What to build, what it must show, and what it must never claim. Written so the
dashboard can be built **before any hardware exists** — every contract below is
already frozen by the shipped dataset and the validated model.

Companion to `DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md` (architecture and hosting) and
`INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (the joins between lanes). Where they disagree, this file
wins, because it was written against the validated model.

## 0. The roles

The idea book §43 names four roles. Two of them carry the demo.

| Role | Audience | Shows | For the demo |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Resident** | the citizen | appliances, protected vs shed, overrides, consent | **Core** |
| **Grid controller** | the DISCOM | declare peak, severity, homes responding, MW relieved | **Core** |
| Team / admin | the team | registries, models, experiments | Later |
| Hardware operator | Charu, Harini | device health, actuation faults, maintenance | Later |
| Rig OLED | the room | what the hardware itself believes | **Core** |

**The grid controller is core, not future scope.** The idea book calls it "a
future grid controller"; that is superseded. Without it there is nothing to
*show* declaring a peak, and the demo's whole narrative is: the grid asks, the
household answers, and nobody is blacked out. It is the screen that makes the
equity claim visible rather than asserted.

What does not change is the limit the idea book puts on it: a grid controller
**may publish authenticated events but can never bypass household safety**.
`apply_shield` raises if a peak lockout names a critical load. Even the DISCOM
cannot take your fan.

The grid controller view and the peak-event mechanism are specified in
`GRID_CONTROLLER_AND_TARIFF.md`, along with the tariff basis and the opt-out
billing. Read that before building Panel 2 or Panel 7.

**Run the demo peak at MIDDAY.** The measured grid peak in the shipped data is
08:00-17:00; severity is exactly 0.000 after 18:00. Household load peaks at
19:00, which is a different event. Any script that says "evening, severity
crosses 0.5" contradicts the data.

---

## 1. What this dashboard is for

It makes a cyber-physical control loop **legible**. It does not make the control
decision and it does not drive GPIO.

Three questions a reviewer will ask, which the UI has to answer on screen:

1. What did the agent *want* to do, and why?
2. What did the safety shield *refuse*, and why?
3. What happened when a human disagreed?

A dashboard that only plots power answers none of them.

---

## 2. The ten appliances

Ownership is measured across the 431 target households — no inverter, no solar.
These ids are frozen: the Pi, the dashboard and the rig must all spell them the
same way.

The idea book's four classes: **Critical** never interrupted, **Thermostatic**
adjusted inside comfort bands, **Deferrable** moved in time, **Interruptible**
paused briefly.

| id | Appliance | Class | Legal levels | Watts | Owns it |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ceiling_fan_01` | Ceiling fan | **Critical** | **1 only** | 60.0 | 97.0 % |
| `table_fan_01` | Table fan | **Critical** | **1 only** | 40.0 | 12.3 % |
| `led_bulb_01` | Light 1 | **Critical** | **1 only** | 9.0 | 68.9 % |
| `led_tube_01` | Light 2 | **Critical** | **1 only** | 18.0 | 33.2 % |
| `refrigerator_01` | Refrigerator | **Critical + thermostatic** | **1 only** | 43.2 | 30.4 % |
| `air_conditioner_01` | Air conditioner | Thermostatic | 0, 1 + advisory setpoint | 1328.4 | 5.6 % |
| `washing_machine_01` | Washing machine | Deferrable | 0, 1 | 113.7 | 8.6 % |
| `ev_charger_01` | **EV charger** | Deferrable | 0, 1 + deadline | — | — |
| `television_01` | Television | Interruptible | 0, 1 | 104.6 | 78.9 % |
| `mixer_grinder_01` | Mixer grinder | Interruptible | 0, 1 | 500.0 | 51.7 % |

**Five Critical.** That matters for Panel 4: with five protected loads, "the top
row never moves during a peak" is visible rather than anecdotal.

**The EV charger is a forward-looking extension.** No electric vehicle appeared
in IRES 2020, so it is handled through the Deferrable class alongside the washing
machine and must be labelled as such wherever it is shown — not presented as a
validated result.

**Level 0 is not offered on a necessity appliance.** Not greyed out after the
fact — never rendered as available. The fan, the light and the fridge cannot be
shed, by anyone, including the resident.

**Level 2 is not offered at all in this build.** A critical load is never shed
*and never dimmed* while the occupant is using it, and the only non-critical
dimmable appliance in these homes is the air cooler — 44 devices out of 4,124.
(2,460 devices can physically dim, but they are overwhelmingly fans and
lights, and a critical load is never dimmed.)
The dashboard therefore renders **two states, ON and SHED**, and a critical load
renders as ON with no control at all.

The protection is conditional, and the UI must reflect that: a fridge nobody is
asking for at 3 a.m. is legitimately off. Protecting essential service does not
mean running it around the clock.

### The two overrides are in series

```
appliance runs = physical switch ON  AND  power available
```

A resident may switch anything off, including their own fan. Neither path can
force power ON. So the override button is a **request**, and the UI must never
imply it is a command - during a peak, tapping "keep the TV on" returns a
refusal with a reason, not a state change.

**The dashboard is the ONLY override path in this build.** There are no physical
switches on the rig. The shield is unaffected: it branches on who asked rather
than how, so a phone OFF is honoured exactly as a flipped switch would be.

One consequence the UI must handle: a phone override needs the broker and the Pi
reachable, and a switch does not. When the connection is down, **disable the
override controls and say why** rather than accepting a tap that will never
arrive.

| Actor | Action | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| SHARP | shed or dim a critical load in use | **never** |
| Resident | switch off their own fan | **yes** |
| Resident | switch on a locked-out luxury | **no - no power there** |

### The air conditioner is a special case

The agent may switch it **on or off**. It may **not** set the temperature. The
dashboard shows a *recommended* setpoint as advice the resident can act on:

```
Suggested: 26 °C   (grid peak severity 0.7, you are in the ₹6.00 slab)
```

Advisory only, this cycle. Automating it is future work and must not be
implied by the UI.

---

## 3. The levels, and what the resident sees

```
0 = OFF       shed      - luxury loads only
1 = ON        full power
2 = REDUCED   reserved; not used on any critical load
```

| State | Treatment | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| `PROTECTED` | solid, **no control shown** | fan, light, fridge in use |
| `ON` | solid, control shown | luxury currently served |
| `SHED` | outline only, reason on hover | luxury paused by SHARP |

**A critical appliance must render with no off control at all** — not a greyed
toggle. The resident should never see a button that would cut their fan, because
no such action exists anywhere in the system.

Level 2 stays in the contract and in `reduced_power_fraction` so dimming can be
reintroduced without a schema change. It is simply never selected today.

---

## 4. Panels

Ten panels. Panels 4, 5 and 6 are the ones that carry the argument.

| # | Panel | Shows | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Live demand | aggregate kW, 96-step sparkline, sanctioned-load line | `sensor/*` |
| 2 | Grid condition | peak severity, percentile, peak badge | `state` |
| 3 | Tariff | marginal ₹/kWh, slab position, month-to-date kWh | `state` |
| 4 | **Appliances** | per device: **three-state** control, class badge, watts | `state` + `ack` |
| 5 | **Proposed action** | what the agent wants **and why** | `intent` |
| 6 | **Safety blocks** | what the shield refused, with reasons | `intent.shield_reasons` |
| 7 | Override | per-appliance request buttons | → FastAPI |
| 8 | Power flow | grid → house, animated | `sensor/source/*` |
| 9 | Outage mode | battery runway, objective switch | `state.mode_islanded` |
| 10 | Results | **peak, PAR**, comfort hours, override rate | FastAPI metrics |

### The headline is equity, not savings

The line that carries the project:

> **We do not choose which village goes dark. We take the television from
> everyone so that nobody goes dark.**

Measured on 30 held-out household-days (seed 7), SHARP cuts household peak by
**10.7 %** — the same relief a rolling blackout would get by cutting supply to
**11 homes in 100**, delivered without cutting anyone.

Two things must be said alongside that number, or the claim is overstated. The
**median** per-household-day change is **0.0 %**: on most days SHARP changes
nothing, and the gain is concentrated in a minority of days. And the figure is a
mean over households, not a promise about any one home.

Panel 10 should say that in those terms. "Peak avoided, equivalent to N homes
not blacked out" is the number a DISCOM and a citizen both understand.

### Panel 10 must lead with peak and PAR, not cost

This is the most important design decision in the document.

APCPDCL's domestic tariff is **telescopic on monthly units with no time-of-day
rate** (`time_of_day_rates: false`). Shifting load in time therefore saves the
household **nothing**. Measured on 30 held-out household-days, seed 7:

| Metric | No control | Rule-based | **SHARP** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Peak kW | 0.315 | 0.312 | **0.281** |
| Peak-to-average | 2.805 | 2.967 | **2.650** |
| Cost ₹/day | 11.53 | **11.08** | 11.39 |

SHARP wins peak and PAR; the rule-based controller makes **both worse than
doing nothing**. On cost the rule-based controller wins, and the dashboard must
not imply otherwise. Lead with peak reduction and PAR. If cost is shown at all,
show it honestly.

### Panel 6 is what a reviewer will ask about

When a resident tries to shed the fridge and the system refuses, that refusal
appears on screen with its reason. Violations become evidence. In validation the
shield refused **0 of 4,103** entitled necessity requests — it never had to,
because the agent never asked — but the panel must still render a refusal
correctly when one occurs, and the demo script deliberately triggers one.

---

## 4b. The billing simulator — core, not optional

Idea book §44-47. This is **Vaishnavi's named deliverable** ("billing engine")
and it is the largest gap between what is specified and what is built.

### What it computes

```
interval_kWh   = active_power_kW x interval_hours
energy_charge  = sum(interval_kWh x tariff_rate[period])
estimated_bill = energy_charge + fixed_charge + demand_charge + tax
                 + penalty - rebate
estimated_savings = baseline_estimated_bill - SHARP_estimated_bill
```

### Three scenarios, side by side

**No control | Rule-based | SHARP.** One number alone means nothing; the
comparison is the point. Be ready for the honest result: on the measured data
the rule-based controller **wins on cost** and SHARP wins on peak and PAR. Show
that rather than hiding it - see §10.

### The bill explanation (§47)

Total estimated bill, base bill without control, estimated savings,
peak-period contribution, **per-appliance contribution**, penalty and rebate
breakdown, and uncertainty.

**The resident must be able to drill from a bill line down to the intervals and
the decisions that produced it.** That is the requirement that makes stored
history mandatory - a live feed alone cannot answer "why is this line this
amount?".

### Three rules that are easy to break

1. **Every amount is marked simulated or estimated**, and shows the tariff
   version and the assumptions behind it.
2. **Never invent a penalty** and present it as a real utility charge (§46). A
   penalty may be modelled only when the selected tariff or programme actually
   defines one - sanctioned-load exceedance, maximum-demand charges, late
   payment, or demand-response non-performance.
3. **APCPDCL has no domestic time-of-day rate.** The tariff is telescopic on
   monthly units. Any peak surcharge shown is a **proposal**, labelled as such,
   never presented as a bill the utility would actually issue.

### Out of scope for this build

Utility account linking, authorised bill import, meter reconciliation and
payment status (§48). Appliance-level *actual* billing (§49) needs submeter or
verified disaggregation - **never claim revenue-grade appliance billing from a
single PZEM channel or from NILM.**

---

## 5. Data contracts

Keep in `lib/contracts.ts`. These are frozen by the dataset; changing them
silently breaks the Pi.

```ts
export type ActionLevel = 0 | 1 | 2;                 // off | on | reduced
export type OperatingMode = 'grid_import' | 'self_sufficient' | 'islanded_outage';
export type ServiceClass = 'necessity' | 'thermostatic' | 'deferrable' | 'interruptible';

export interface ApplianceState {
  appliance_id: string;            // 'ceiling_fan_01'
  appliance_type: string;          // matches the dataset's appliance_type
  service_class: ServiceClass;
  is_necessity: boolean;           // true -> level 0 is NEVER offered
  supports_reduced: boolean;       // true -> the dim control exists
  level: ActionLevel;
  power_15min_mean_w: number;      // SIMULATED appliance wattage
  measured_w: number | null;       // null in this build - no meter fitted
  gpio_state: 0 | 1;               // real pin readback - a true measurement
  actuation_verified: boolean;     // gpio_state agrees with the command
  remaining_service_hours: number;
}

export interface HomeState {
  house_id: string;
  timestamp_ist: string;
  aggregate_power_kw: number;
  background_load_kw: number;      // unmodelled, NOT controllable - see below
  sanctioned_load_kw: number;
  indoor_temperature_c: number;
  outdoor_temperature_c: number;
  occupancy_adult_home_fraction: number;
  attention_available: boolean;
  marginal_tariff_inr_kwh: number;
  month_to_date_kwh: number;
  grid_peak_severity: number;      // 0..1, drives the peak badge
  operating_mode: OperatingMode;
  battery_state_of_charge: number;
  grid_absent: boolean;
  appliances: ApplianceState[];
}

export interface Intent {
  command_id: string;
  proposed: Record<string, ActionLevel>;
  executed: Record<string, ActionLevel>;
  shield_reasons: Record<string, string[]>;   // why a level was refused
  policy_source: string;                      // 'bdq_v2_cql'
  decision_latency_ms: number;
}
```

`rejected_reason` is a closed set. Do not invent strings:

```
necessity_mask | compressor_protection | cycle_active | min_on_steps
min_off_steps | command_expired | level_not_supported | watchdog_hold
```

### Two fields that are load-bearing

**There is no PZEM in this build, so `measured_w` is `null` — never a simulated
number.** Show the simulated wattage everywhere; that is what the rig exists for.
Just never put it in a field named *measured*, or a stuck relay, a failed GPIO
write and a wiring fault all become invisible behind a number that says the
appliance is running regardless.

`gpio_state` is the real signal available without a meter. An output pin read
back reports what it is actually driving, which catches a failed write, a
mis-numbered pin, and a pin held by another process. It will not catch a
physically stuck relay — nothing without a sensor will — so say that rather than
imply full verification.

Render **`actuation_verified`** per appliance. A mismatch between commanded and
actual is the most valuable fault the rig can surface, and it costs nothing.

**`background_load_kw` is 61 % of household load and is not controllable.** It is
unmodelled draw calibrated against these households' own reported bills. Show it
as a distinct, uncontrollable band in Panel 1. If the UI implies the agent can
act on it, every result looks inexplicably small.

---

## 6. Build order — all of this needs no hardware

| # | Step | Blocked on |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Replay publisher: dataset transitions → MQTT at 1 step/sec | nothing |
| 2 | Panels 1–4 against replayed state | 1 |
| 3 | Panels 5–6 against `intent` | 1 |
| 4 | Override → FastAPI → MQTT | broker credentials |
| 5 | Panel 10 metrics | FastAPI |
| 6 | Swap the replay publisher for the real Pi | Harini |

**Step 1 is the critical path for the whole team.** It unblocks the dashboard and
gives Harini realistic `state` messages to test against. It needs no model and no
Pi:

```python
d = pd.read_parquet('.../splits/validation.parquet')
episode = d[d.episode_id == d.episode_id.iloc[0]].sort_values('step_id')
for _, row in episode.iterrows():
    client.publish('home/demo/state', json.dumps(to_home_state(row)))
    time.sleep(1)                      # 96 steps = one simulated day in 96 s
```

---

## 7. Failure states the UI must render

A dashboard that shows stale data as live is worse than one that shows nothing.

| Condition | Required behaviour |
|---|---|
| No state for 2 intervals | Grey the panel, show data age in minutes |
| `ack.accepted = false` | Show the appliance as **refused**, with the reason |
| Command past `expires_at` | Show as expired, not as applied |
| Duplicate `command_id` | Ignore the second; do not toggle twice |
| MQTT disconnected | Banner, reconnect with backoff, re-read retained state |
| `grid_absent = true` | Outage mode: only inverter-circuit loads live |

---

## 8. Credentials

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are **visible to anyone who opens the page**. Not
obscured — visible.

| Variable | Value | Exposed |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MQTT_URL` | `wss://...:8884/mqtt` | yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MQTT_USER` | **subscribe-only** user | yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MQTT_PASS` | that user's password | yes |
| `API_BASE_URL`, `API_TOKEN` | server side only | no |

The browser gets a read-only broker user. If it leaks, someone reads demo
telemetry. If you put the publishing credential there instead, anyone on the
internet can command your relays.

Overrides go browser → FastAPI (authenticated server-side) → broker. That is the
main reason the backend exists.

---

## 9. Demo script

1. **Normal** — evening, moderate load, everything on.
2. **Peak** — severity crosses 0.5. The fan drops to **DIM**, the TV sheds.
   Fridge and lights stay. *This is the money shot.*
3. **Override** — resident restores the TV. Honoured. Preference pair recorded.
4. **Blocked override** — resident tries to shed the fridge. **Refused**, reason
   on screen, Panel 6.
5. **Outage** — grid drops. AC and TV go dead; fan and lights continue on the
   inverter circuit.
6. **Recovery** — grid returns.

Step 5 separates this from a UK-style demo. The dataset carries 28,116 outage
steps from IRES-reported supply hours.

---

## 10. What the dashboard must not claim

- Do not label simulated power as measured.
- Do not show a cost saving as the headline. Under this tariff there is almost
  none available, and the rule-based baseline beats SHARP on it.
- Do not imply the AC setpoint is automated. It is advisory.
- Do not show the model as "approved for deployment". Every validation report
  says `approved_for_deployment: false`, and that is deliberate.
- Override and occupancy data in the replay are **synthetic**, generated from a
  stated behavioural rule. Label them so in any screenshot that reaches a report.

The validated model: 17 of 17 gates passed, balanced accuracy 0.7478 against a
0.3333 floor, dim recall 0.6345, and **0 of 4,103** necessity loads shed while
the occupant was entitled to them.
