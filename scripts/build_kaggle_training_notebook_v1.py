# SHARP — training the Branching Dueling Double-Q policy

Trains the SHARP home energy controller entirely on Kaggle, from the published
dataset. **pandas and numpy only** — no deep-learning framework, because the
policy has to run on a Raspberry Pi, and a NumPy forward pass is three matrix
multiplies with no runtime to install on an ARM board.

**Before you run:** add the dataset `sharp-master-dataset-v2` through
*Add Data* in the right-hand panel, then *Run All*. Accelerator: **None**
(this is CPU work; a GPU will not make it faster).

What this notebook does, in order:

1. Load the pre-split transitions and build the per-branch legality mask
2. Behaviour-cloning warm start
3. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) — the offline correction that matters
4. Evaluate with metrics that **cannot be fooled by the majority class**
5. Fit the Bradley-Terry preference reward (E2)
6. Export the weights for the Pi

**The test split is never read.** Not in any cell here.

## 3. The legality mask — do not skip this

Level 2 (REDUCED) is only physically meaningful on an appliance that can dim or
run slow: fans, coolers, and most lighting. It is meaningless on a television or
a water pump.

Without a mask, `argmax` over three levels can pick REDUCED on a device that
cannot dim — and roughly **40 % of devices cannot**. The shield would refuse it
at actuation time, but by then the Q values have already been trained as though
the level existed, and the bootstrap target may have been built from it.

We confirm the mask against the logged data first: if the behaviour policies
never chose level 2 on a non-dimmable device, the mask is safe to impose.

Note what we deliberately do **not** mask: OFF on a necessity appliance. The
necessity rule is *conditional* — necessity loads are protected when the
occupant wants them, not pinned on around the clock — so OFF is a legitimate
logged action for a fridge at 3 a.m.

## 6. Evaluation — metrics that cannot be gamed

Two traps, both of which caught earlier versions of this work.

**Trap 1: pooled TD error.** The unmet-service penalty lands as a single lump at
step 95, so terminal rewards are roughly **77×** step rewards. A pooled TD number
is dominated by the 1 % of rows that are terminal. Worse, the two move in
opposite directions: non-terminal TD falls while terminal TD rises. Reported
together, that reads as progress. So they are reported apart.

**Trap 2: raw agreement with the logged action.** 83 % of logged actions are OFF.
A model that answers OFF unconditionally scores **0.83** and has learned nothing.
The headline is therefore **balanced accuracy** — the mean of the three per-level
recalls — which that model scores 0.333 on, exactly chance.

Normalisation is fitted on **train only**. About 37 of the 305 features have zero

### Reading the result

`balanced_accuracy` is the number to watch, against a floor of 0.3333.

Check `greedy_share` against `logged_share` every time. If greedy OFF is near
1.0 and the other two recalls are near zero, the model has collapsed to the
majority class — raw agreement will look excellent and the controller will be
useless. That is what inverse-frequency weighting exists to prevent.

`illegal_greedy_picks` must be **0**. Anything else means the legality mask is
not being applied where it should be.

## 7.2 Hyperparameter search

Search design contributed by **Gudala Padma Pranitha**. Random search over the
knobs earlier ablations showed were sensitive, deliberately **excluding**
`PEAK_WEIGHT`, `COST_WEIGHT` and the illegal-action penalty — those are
reward-shaping and safety choices grounded in the domain reasoning above, not
free parameters to search over. That judgement is hers and it is right.

**One thing changed from the original, and it matters.** Her version picks the
winner by balanced accuracy. That cannot work here: the logged action equals the
occupant's request **96.35 %** of the time, so agreement with logged behaviour
mostly measures *how closely a controller reproduces doing nothing*. A search
maximising it walks away from demand response.

An in-notebook proxy for control quality was tried and **rejected** — scoring
the fraction of discretionary load shed during peaks against off-peak ranked
five known checkpoints at Spearman **−0.900** versus the simulator, almost
perfectly inverted. A policy that sheds hard during a peak looks well targeted
and simply gets overridden, so no peak is avoided.

So this search does what can be done honestly inside a notebook: it trains the
trials, gates them, uses balanced accuracy **only as a sanity filter** (a model
near the 0.3333 floor has not learned the state space), and hands the survivors
on. **Control quality is decided in the simulator, offline**, by
`scripts/final_model_selection_v1.py`, across several seeds — the four leading
checkpoints there sit within 0.002 kW of each other while changing the seed
moves any one of them by more than 0.1 kW, so single-run differences are noise.

## 9. The Bradley-Terry preference reward (E2)

Every time the simulated occupant overrode the controller, the dataset recorded
two actions for the same device in the same state: what the controller settled
on, and what the occupant asked for instead. That is a preference comparison,
and comparisons are enough to fit a reward without hand-setting a comfort weight:

```
P(preferred beats proposed) = sigmoid( r(s, i, a_pref) − r(s, i, a_prop) )
```

### Read this before quoting a number

**Every pair points the same way** — preferred = ON, proposed = OFF — because a
pair is only recorded when someone overrode a shed. So the constant rule *"the
occupant always wants it on"* scores **100 %**, and the classification accuracy
of this model is not a result. It does not belong in the abstract.

What *is* a result is the **margin**: `r(s,i,ON) − r(s,i,OFF)` is a learned,
state-dependent measure of how badly the occupant wants that appliance back —
which is exactly what a reward needs to supply. So the cell below reports
whether the margin recovers the generator's own override pressure on held-out
households and dates, and whether it decays as response latency grows.

To make the *direction* informative too, the pair generator would have to emit
comparisons where the occupant let a shed stand. That is a dataset change, not a
notebook change.

## 11. What you must not claim

- A falling TD error is **not** evidence of policy quality. Offline RL without a
  distribution-shift correction can overestimate confidently and be wrong; CQL
  reduces that, it does not remove it.
- Balanced accuracy measures **imitation of three scripted behaviour policies**.
  It is not control performance. Real performance needs the simulator in the
  loop — cost against baseline, peak-to-average ratio, comfort hours.
- Override and attention evidence is **synthetic**, from a stated behavioural
  rule. No dataset records real demand-response overrides in an Indian home;
  that is what the Pi deployment is for.
- The preference model's **accuracy is not a result** — every pair points the
  same way. Quote the margin correlations.
- Appliance power is a proxy: **685 of 4,124** devices are measurement-grounded
  (512 REFIT, 173 iAWE); the rest are declared assumptions.
- Thermal parameters are **declared assumptions** bounded by the RESIDE
  envelope. A fitted coefficient was attempted and rejected — it lost to plain
  persistence in 7 of 11 houses.
- REFIT is 20 **UK** homes. iAWE is **one** Delhi home. RESIDE is 11 **Hyderabad**
  houses over 19 days.
- **Do not touch the test split** until you report final numbers, once.

`scope_and_limits` in `rl_transitions/transition_validation.json` carries all of
this. Copy it into the report rather than paraphrasing it.

## Next

1. Download `sharp_policy_bdq_v2.npz` and `golden_vector.json` from the Output
   panel and hand both to the hardware lane.
2. The golden vector is Join 1 in the integration guide — the check that catches
   a state-builder mismatch, which otherwise fails silently.
3. The shield runs on the Pi **after** this model, unchanged. It is the last word.
